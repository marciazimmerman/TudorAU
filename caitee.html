	<h1>Caitee Howard</h1>
	<p>Catherine "Caitee" Howard was Henry's fifth spouse and fourth wife.</p>

	<h3 class="country-of-birth">Origin</h3>
	<p>Catherine Vesely was born in Austin, Texas and moved to Los Angeles early in life. As a bubbly and flirtatious child, she was nicknamed "Caity" when there were multiple girls named Catherine/Kateryn/Kate in her classroom. She adopted the spelling "Caitee" when she began middle school. Although she was never formally adopted by her mother's new husband, she assumed his surname Howard because it was easy to spell.</p>
	
	<h3 id="salient-characteristic">Unusual physical detail</h3>
	<p>Caitee has heterochromic eyes. Her left eye is gray-green-blue and her right eye is golden brown. During her time as a paid Instagram model, she wore contact lenses with a pronounced limbal ring.</p>
	
	<h3 class="professional-life">Professional life</h3>
	<p>Initially Caitee enrolled at De Anza Community College, but then told Henry she wished to follow in her mother's footsteps as a cellist. She also became an Instagram model on the strength of Henry's connections, receiving clothes and money in exchange for promoting Silicon Valley style on her pages.</p>

	<p>Henry adored Caitee's youth, charm, and vivaciousness, and considered his life with her a respite from his daily grind as a magnate surrounded by hyperintelligent, snarky techies. However, that same daily grind separated them for long hours. Caitee began an affair with her cello instructor, a music major at Stanford, and was rumored to be dallying with a Looper employee who wrote on Reddit: "I would sit in these meetings he was leading, and the meetings would end and he'd go back to work with his inner circle and I'd go to Santana Row and bang Caitee."</p>
	<p>Eventually an incensed Henry filed for divorce, saying famously on Reddit: <em>I wouldn't have chosen to air things on Reddit, but this is where the rumors started, so this is where the rumors will end. I've politely asked Catherine to move out. I've filed for divorce. As far as I am concerned, she's free to do whatever and whomever she wants as of right now. We did not have a prenup. In lieu of alimony, I've given her $100,000. This concludes our relationship and I will not initiate any more personal contact with her.</em></p>
