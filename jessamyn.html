    <h1>Jessamyn Siy</h1>
    <p>Jessamyn Siy was Henry's third wife and third spouse.</p>
    
    <h3 class="country-of-origin">Origin</h3>
    <p>Jessamyn was born in the Philippines and came to the United States as a child. She grew up in Daly City, California.</p>
    
    <h3 class="issue">Issue</h3>
    <p>Together Jessamyn and Henry had one son, Joel Henry Edward Tudor.</p>
    
    <h3 class="relationship-with-henry">Relationship with Henry</h3>
    
    <p>Henry was adamant that his first son carry his first and last names; the couple reached consensus on "Edward," and Jessamyn chose the name "Joel." Henry wanted to use "Edward" as the boy's day-to-day name, but Jessamyn withheld judgment, saying, "He may act like a Joel."</p>
    
    <h4 class="henrys-feelings-about">Henry's feelings about her</h4>
    <p>Henry was crushed after Jessamyn's death. His subsequent relationship with Andreas may have sprung from the notion that he certainly would never love a woman again the way he loved Jessamyn. A man, on the other hand...</p>
    
    <h3 class="death">Death</h3>
    <p>Jessamyn returned to work at her group dental practice six weeks after her son's birth. Near the end of her first week, she sat in the staff lounge to relax with a cup of coffee, had a stroke, and died.</p>
