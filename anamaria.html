	<h1>Anamaria Aragon</h1>
	<p>Anamaria Aragon was Henry's first spouse and first wife.</p>

	<h3 class="country-of-birth">Origin</h3>
	<p>Anamaria was born in Riverside, California. Her parents were both born in Mexico.</p>
	
	<h3 class="professional-life">Professional life</h3>
	<p>Dr Anamaria Aragon is a pediatrician who struggled with depression after the death of her first daughter. She shares custody of Mary with Henry; now that Mary is older, Anamaria flies missions with Doctors Without Borders.</p>
	
	<h3 class="relationship-with-henry">Her relationship with Henry</h3>
	<p>Anamaria and Henry met briefly at a conference in high school, then again in college. At the time, they shared both a deep spiritual faith and believed that faith would see them through combining children and a thriving professional life. However, when Anamaria did not immediately become pregnant, Henry suggested she stop out of medical school, and their paths began to diverge. After Mary was born, Anamaria was angry at Henry's pursuit of producing a son, and had rethought the likelihood of having several children vs one or two. Henry's eye began to wander, and when Anamaria saw photographs and Valley gossip with Rachel Boleyn in the company of Henry, she asked for a divorce.</p>
	
	<p>Today, she says, "I couldn't make him happy, fine; I'll live in order to make my daughter and myself happy. Turns out no one can make him happy, apparently."</p>
 
	<h3 class="issue">Issue</h3>
	<p>Anamaria and Henry produced a stillborn daughter named Isabela, and a daughter named Mary.</p>
